So far what me and my partner have done is we created the MVP of our game.
We made so that the player can move with the arrow keys using the function `onKeyDown` which when runned, allows the user to move either up, down, left or right.
We also added a random apple spawner generator that spawns apples anywhere on the map and the user can use the arrow keys to collect the apple and gain points. We used the functions `spawnApple` to spawn the apples at random positions, and we used the function `appleCounter` to count everytime the user collects the apple. Finally, when the user has collected 10 apples, the text `Congradulations you win!` text pops up on their screen. For that we used the function `gameOver(win)` once the user collected at least 10 apples
 Which is basically the very minumun and the basics of our game. Our goal right now is to work on the beyond MVP which is to create more More maps, more stages after a player collects enough coins to progress and keep the player interested.A Also more obstacles, use different shaped obstacles such as sharp traps, maybe different types of enemies that move differently( i think the enemies part is cool) more visually appealing, and finally using different color palettes and animations to make it look better.
