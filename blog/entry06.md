# Entry 6
##### 6/7/24

### Takeaways
Some takeaways I had from the in class presentation was that I feel like me and my partners hook was good. However, we should've talked a bit more about the challenges of our freedom project.
I unfortunately wasn't able to show up to the expo elevator pitch so I had no takeaways on it. However, I had my elevator pitch ready.

### EDP
On the EDP we are up to the improve part because we are looking foward to making our game much better by adding obstacles in the future, and basically replicating the snake game where as you eat more apples, you will increase size. We also want to improve the game by adding a better background and adding levels to the game so the user will enjoy the game more.

### Skills
Some skills that I have developed during this is defenitley public speaking and time management. Public Speaking because I talked in front of the whole class and time management because I learned how to manage my time with making the projected on a certain day each week whenever me and my partner were both free.

# Blog Overview
The purpose of my Freedom Project was to show that I was capable of making a game even though I was new to using kaboom.js. I wanted to prove to myself that making a game was not that hard and takes dedication. The content of the blogs helped me develop up to this point because each blog had different takeaways and challenges that I had with this project. This is a positive impact on the Economic society because a lot of people have jobs and get stressed very often. To release that stress, this game will help them cool down. By having fun playing our Fruit Game. Some negative impact this will have is that if it becomes too addicting, then people will procrastinate a lot and won't have a lot of time to do other things.
